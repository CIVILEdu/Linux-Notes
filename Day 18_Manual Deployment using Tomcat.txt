Day 18
=========================================
Manual deployment of an application - Tomcat
--------------------------------------------------------
=> In order to deploy any application, we need a server. If we want to deploy a java based web application, for this I need a web sever.

=> The web server which is available to deploy the java based web application is Apache Tomcat.

=> Maven (war file) ----> Deployment (Tomcat) = Deployment process.

=> For java web applications, we use below servers;
	1. Apache Tomcat, 2. JBoss, 3. Weblogic, 4. Websphere ....

Manual deployment
---------------------------
=> Java web applications will be deployed in the form of war files.

=> Java standalone applications will be deployed in the form of jar files.

=> Here we dont use any physical servers. So here we will use virtual servers provided by the cloud service providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).

=> AWS ----> EC2 ----> Launch an instance ----> Install tomcat ----> Deploy the war of the app. ----> Access the application (We will see the Hello World sample page).

=> Apache is the name of the organization. Tomcat is the name of the server.

=> Tomcat is an open-source s/w and it is available for FREE.

=> Tomcat server will run on port number 8080.

How to download the tomcat server into the local system
----------------------------------------------------------------------
https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
Click on Tomcat 9 in the downloads section

Folder structure of tomcat server
-----------------------------------------
=> BIN - It contains the files to start and stop the tomcat server.
		(.sh files - are used for linux OS) ----> startup.sh (This is used to start the server), shutdown.sh (This is used to stop the server)
		(.bat files - are used for window OS) ----> startup.bat (This is used to start the server), shutdown.bat (This is used to stop the server)

=> CONF - It contains configuration files
			(server.xml ----> To configure the tomcat port number)
			(tomcat-users.xml ---->  To configure the user details)

=> LIB - Library folder contains librariers i.e jar files

=> LOGS - It contains the server logs i.e execution details

=> TEMP - It contains the temporary data

=> WEBAPPS - In this folder we will keep the application war files. It is also called as "Deployment" folder.

Process
--------------
Developers (Write the code) ----> Push the code repo. ----> Clone the repo. ----> Package the file ----> war file ----> Keep the war file in the webapps folder.

=> We can keep multiple war files in the webapps folder. But it is not suggested.

Working with Tomcat in the linux ec2 instance
-----------------------------------------------------------
~ Launch the Linux based VM
~ Connect to the Instance
~ Install Java Software:
	To install Java 11 on Amazon Linux:
	sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

	To install Java 08 on Amazon Linux:
	sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
~ Check the Java Version:
	java -version

Installation of Tomcat Web Server in Linux based VM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
~ Since the VM is Linux based OS, we will install the "tar" file of Apache Tomcat Web Server
		https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
~ Keep the cursor on tar.gz file and right click and select Copy link address
~ To install the Webserver:  (Tar file of Apache Tomcat will get installed)
~ Extract the tar file
	tar -xvf <Name visibile in the red colour in the above link>
	ls -l (You can see the extracted file in blue clolor)
~ cd <Enter the name visibile in blue colour in above line>
	ls -l (To see the folder structure)

Starting the Tomcat Sever
------------------------------------------
~ To start the server, we need to access the startup.sh file. This file is available in BIN Folder
~ cd bin/
~ To start the sever, 
	./startup.sh (You can see "Tomcat Started")

Accessing Tomcat Server
--------------------------------------
~ Copy the Public IP of EC2 Instance and paste in new tab ---- You can see the error page. This is because, the port no. 8080 is not enabled.

~ Enable Port No. 8080 in SGs of EC2 Instance.

~ After enabling the port no 8080, go to new tab,
		<Paste the public IP of instance>:8080/ -----------You can see tomcat server page

Deploy the Web Application in Tomcat Server
---------------------------------------------------------------
The war file has to be deployed in the WEBAPPS Folder

Goto 02-Maven-WebApp-CivilEdu -----> Open Command Prompt in that path ----> Lets package the project -----> mvn clean package -----> You can see Build Success ----> You can see the war file in target folder

Since we are accessing the Tomcat in our PC, we can only access the HOME PAGE of TOMCAT. We cannot perform the Admin activities from our PC.
To perform the admin activities from our PC, we need to edit the "context.xml" file

Editing the context.xml to give the Admin permissions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File path of context.xml:
	cd tomcat/webapss/manager/META-INF/context.xml

vi context.xml ----> Edit the allow tag -----> ".*" />

Configuring the Users in Tomcat
---------------------------------------------
we need to edit the tomcat-users.xml to configure the users. 
The "tomcat-users.xml" file is available in "conf" folder

<role rolename="manager-gui" />
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui" />
<role rolename="admin-gui" />  
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>

Click on Server Status ----> Enter the username (admin) and password (admin)

Deploying the "war" file of our application
------------------------------------------------------------
Scroll down to see "War file to deploy" -----> Click on Choose File ----> Select the war file from our PC ----> Click on "Deploy" 
You can see our application under "List Applications"

Click on the Application Name (02-Maven-WebApp-CivilEdu) -----> You will be able to see the HELLO WORLD!

Note: HELLO WORLD! is seen because it is available in index.jsp file which is there in "target folder"


This is all about the Manual Deployment.
