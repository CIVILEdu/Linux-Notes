9. How to create files in linux OS?
=> In linux OS we can create files in 3 ways;

	2. cat
	3. vi
9.1 How to create an empty file?
$ touch <file-name>
9.2 How to create a file with some content inside it?
$ cat > <file-name>
It will ask you to enter the data inside the file. Enter some data. 
Once after writing the data inside the file, to comeout/exit, use "control+d"

Note: If file-name is not available, Linux will create that file in the backend and allows us to write the content inside it.

9.3 How to see the content in a specific file?
$ cat <file-name>

Note: Touch is used to create an empty file.
	  Cat is used to create a file with some content inside it.

10. How to write the additional content inside an existing file?
$ cat > <file-name>
Note: It will delete the old data and will display only the latest data.
10.1 In real-time, we need to protect the old data, by writing the new data.
$ cat >> <file-name>

Note: If you give one > symbol, it will erase the old data and gets replaced with new data.
	 If you give two >> symbols, it will protect the old data and also allows us to write the new data, as well.

11. How to remove a file?
$ rm <file-name>

12. If you to display the list of files based on timestamp (latest to oldest)
$ ls -lt

13. If you to display the list of files based on timestamp (oldest to latest)
$ ls -lr

Note: By default, when we give ls -l, it will print the files in alphabetical order.

14. To print the content of a particular directory
$ ls -l <directory name>
