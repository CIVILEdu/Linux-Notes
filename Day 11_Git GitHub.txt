GIT
--------
=> GIT - Global Information Tracker

Ex: Instagram
	Version 1 - 2015 February 
	Version 1.1 - 2015 November ---- 2015 December (Bugs)
	Version 2 - January 2016
	Version 8 - January 2024
=> GIT was developed by Linus Torvalds in the year 2005.
=> GIT tracks all the types of files and codes on daily basis.
=> The idea of using the of the VCS is to keep the developers and devops engineers in touch with eachother.
=> VCS allows for colloborative development.
=> VCS also helps us to go to the previous version of the code (Rollbacks)

Types of VCS:
--------------------
1. Local VCS
2. Centralised VCS
3. Distribute VCS

Developers and DevOps engineers mostly uses DVCS only.

Some of the DVCS available in the market are: GIT, BIT Bucket, Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce.

GITHUB will act as a host for our code.
