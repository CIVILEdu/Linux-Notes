15. How to remove a directory?
=> If the directory is empty, we can delete that directory using "rmdir <directory-name>"

=> If the directory is not empty, and if you want to delete the files inside a directory along with the directory itself, then
rm -r <directory-name>

16. How to rename a file or a directory?
=> mv command is used to rename a file
Syntax: mv <name of the file you want to change> <modified name>
Ex: mv aws.txt devops.txt
Note: To move the files from one directory to another directory, we can use "mv" command.

17. How to copy the data from one file to another file?
=> Ex: aws.txt (AWS is having 250+ services)
		devops.txt
Syntax: cat <file1 name> > <file2 name>
Ex: cat aws.txt > devops.txt

Note: If File 2 is not available, it will create the file2 and then copies the content from file 1

18. How to copy the data from 2 files to a third file?
Syntax: cat <file1> <file2> > <file3>

19. How to create a copy of a file?
Syntax: cp <file1> <file2>
Note: "cp" is used only for one file
	"cat" is used for copying the content from multiple files to a single file

20. How to move a file from one directory to another directory?
Syntax: mv <path> <path>

21. How to see the first 10 lines available in a file?
$ head <filename>
$ head -n <linenumber> <filename>
The above command will display the contents from top to a specific line number

22. How to see the last 10 lines available in a file?
$ tail <filename>
$ tail -n <linenumber> <filename>
The above command will display the contents from last to a specific line number

Note: By default, whenever we execute "head" and "tail" commands, it will display the first/last 10 lines only.

23. How to see the content available in a specific line?
$ tail +12 <filename>
$ head +10 <filename>


24. How to know the number of words available in a file?
$ wc <file name>
Ex: 7 14 70
First number represents the number of lines available
Second number represents the number of words available
Third number represents the number of characters available

25. How to search for a word in Linux OS?
=> "GREP" command is used to search for a word
=> Global Regular Expression Print.
=> GREP will process the text line by line and prints the lines which contains the given word

Syntax: grep '<wordname>' <filename>
The above command is case sensitive

To ignore the case sensitiveness, use the below command
grep -i '<wordname>' <filename>

To search for a word in all the files available in Linux OS
grep -i '<wordname>' *

26.  How to work with "vi" command?
=> Text editors are used to edit the files in linux OS.
=> Default text editor available in Linux OS is "vi" (Visual Editor)

vi <filename>
It will create the file with the "filename" that you have given and allows us to write the content inside it.
Step 1: vi kastro.txt
Step 2: Press 'i' to go to the insert mode
Step 3: Write the content
Step 4: :wq
Step 5: cat kastro.txt (or) vi kastro.txt - This will display the content inside the kastro.txt file.

Note: After clicking on 'escape' button, if we give :q! it will directly comeout of the file without saving the content.
