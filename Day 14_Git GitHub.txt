GIT BRANCHES
---------------------------
=> By default, whenever we create a repo., we will get a "main" branch
=> Branches are used to maintain the separate code bases for our project
=> In git, we can create multiple branches
=> The advantage of creating multiple branches is in the same repo., we will maintain separate spaces for each team
